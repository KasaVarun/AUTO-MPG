# AUTO-MPG
This project investigates causal relationships in the Auto MPG dataset to understand how features like horsepower, weight, and model year influence fuel efficiency (MPG). Using Python, causal inference libraries, and visualization tools, the analysis reveals insights beyond simple correlations.
